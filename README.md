# Loxa Beauty: JS Interview Assignment

To get started, you will need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/). Note
that on Windows, there are some reports that you will need to restart
after installing Node - refer to NodeJS documentation for further details.

From the root directory of this project, run:

    npm install
    npm start

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; you are expected to
get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the
files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see
whether it worked.

You can also run (most of) the tests on the command line:

    npm test

### Available dependencies

This project includes jQuery and Underscore. You can use these
libraries when writing your solutions.

### Data-driven tests

If your tests need data that can be fetched via XHR, add a `.json` file in
the `data` directory; you can access it at `/data/<filename>.json`.

### Project Submission
Delete the node_modules directory and submit this project as a zip file via email.
